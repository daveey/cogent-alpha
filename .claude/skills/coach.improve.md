# /coach.improve — Iterative Agent Improvement Session

You are the Coach. Your job is to iteratively improve the agent, test changes locally, submit to the tournament, and learn from results.

**Read `cvc/agent/README.md` first.** It has the full guide to how the agent works, how to test locally, submit, check scores, and debug. Do not duplicate that knowledge here — refer to it.

## Directory Layout

```
.coach/
  state.json          # persistent state (best score, last session, etc.)
  todos.md            # running TODO list of improvement ideas
  sessions/
    <timestamp>/
      plan.md         # what this session is trying and why
      log.md          # running log: actions, results, observations, wait status
      diff.patch      # the code diff attempted (if any)
      results.json    # local + tournament results collected
```

## Session Protocol

### Step 1: Load State & Finalize Incomplete Sessions

1. Read `.coach/state.json` and `.coach/todos.md`.
2. Scan `.coach/sessions/` for the most recent session folder.
3. If the last session's `log.md` says **WAITING** (submitted but no results yet):
   - Check tournament scores now (see README for how).
   - Write findings into THIS session's log.
   - If the old session's changes improved scores, keep them. If scores dropped, consider reverting.
   - Update the old session's `results.json` and mark it finalized.

### Step 2: Create New Session

1. Create `.coach/sessions/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
2. Write `plan.md`: current best score/rank, what you're trying, which files, and why.
3. Start `log.md` with a timestamp and plan summary.

### Step 3: Analyze & Choose One Improvement

1. Check current tournament scores (leaderboard + recent matches).
2. Read `.coach/todos.md` for previously identified ideas.
3. Read the relevant policy code (see README for file map).
4. Pick ONE focused improvement. Don't stack multiple changes.

### Step 4: Test Locally

**Before any tournament submission, validate locally:**

```bash
cd /home/user/coglet/cogames
/home/user/.venv-cogames/bin/cogames scrimmage \
  -m machina_1 \
  -p class=cvc.cvc_policy.CogletPolicy \
  -c 8 -e 1 --seed 42 \
  --action-timeout-ms 30000
```

- Check the "Average Per-Agent Reward" in the output.
- Compare against baseline (previous local score before your change).
- If score dropped significantly, reconsider the change before submitting.
- Log the local test result in `log.md`.

For more confidence, run multiple episodes (`-e 3`) or different seeds.

### Step 5: Commit & Submit

1. Save diff: `git diff > .coach/sessions/<session>/diff.patch`
2. Commit with a descriptive message. Push to the feature branch.
3. Submit to tournament (see README for the `ship` command).
4. Log the submission in `log.md` with: "WAITING: submitted, checking results next session"

### Step 6: Update State

1. Update `.coach/state.json` (last_session, local score, etc.)
2. Update `.coach/todos.md` (mark done items, add new ideas, reprioritize)
3. Ensure `log.md` has a clear final status: DONE, WAITING, or FAILED

## Principles

1. **Test locally first.** Never submit untested changes to tournament.
2. **One change at a time.** Make one focused improvement per session.
3. **Don't break what works.** Conservative > ambitious. A regression is worse than no change.
4. **Log everything.** Clear trail of what was tried, local results, tournament results.
5. **Learn from results.** Read match logs. Understand why scores changed.
6. **Git discipline.** Commit before submitting. Push to the feature branch.
