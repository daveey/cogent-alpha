# gamma — Improvement TODOs

## In Progress
- [~] (20260403-011) Teammate proximity penalty increase: 6.0→9.0 (50% increase) for better coordination in 4-team. Testing across seeds 42-46. **CPU testing slow (~15-20min/seed), tests running in background.**

## Completed
- [x] (ID) Wider enemy AOE for retreat: wired _near_enemy_territory (radius 20) into _should_retreat — +458% avg score
- [x] (20260403-001) LLM objective feature: wired up expand/defend/economy_bootstrap objectives to pressure budgets — was broken, now functional
- [x] (20260403-001) Documentation: added four_score.md, updated all docs for multi-team format
- [x] (20260403-004) Hotspot penalty increase: 8→12 base, 5→6 mid → +107.9% on seed 42 (6.03→12.54). Agents avoid contested far junctions in 4-team format.
- [x] (20260403-007) Early scrambler activation: step 100→50 → +7.84% avg (9.03→9.74). Earlier disruption against 3 opponents in 4-team, maintains 50-step resource bootstrap.

## Failed Attempts
- [x] (20260403-002-REVERTED) LLM stagnation: prescriptive role-change rules → -41.6% regression. Too aggressive switching disrupted stability.
- [x] (20260403-003-REVERTED) Early pressure ramp: 30→15 steps → -5.97% regression. Too early, disrupted resource bootstrapping.
- [x] (20260403-005-REVERTED) Defensive scrambling: removed corner_pressure bonus → -0.77% regression. Minimal impact, offensive push may help in 4-team.
- [x] (20260403-006-REVERTED) Network bonus increase: 0.5→1.5 (3×) → -64.2% regression. Too aggressive clustering, agents failed to expand.
- [x] (20260403-008-REVERTED) Scrambler threat_bonus increase: 10.0→15.0 → -17.04% regression. Over-defending existing junctions hurt expansion disruption.
- [x] (20260403-009-REVERTED) Claim duration reduction: 30→20 steps → -53.0% regression. Too short, caused massive claim duplication and wasted coordination.
- [x] (20260403-010-REVERTED) Mid-game pressure ramp: step 3000→2000 → -47.13% regression. Premature resource burn, exhausted economy before sustainable.

## Candidates
- [ ] Read teammate vibes: Count nearby teammate roles to avoid duplicate aligners heading to same area
- [ ] LLM stagnation detection: SOFTER approach - detect oscillation/stalled behavior, suggest gentle role switches
- [ ] Teammate vibe awareness in targeting: If teammate vibe shows aligning to nearby junction, deprioritize that junction
- [ ] Test mixed-policy matches (vs alpha.0, corgy) to validate competitive performance
- [ ] Four_score spawn corners: Adjust initial exploration offsets for corner spawns vs center hubs
- [ ] Claim duration: Don't reduce globally - maybe reduce only for far junctions (>30 distance)?
- [ ] Analyze why stalled detection triggers: is threshold too sensitive? Are agents frequently stalling legitimately?

## Blockers
- [ ] COGAMES_TOKEN auth: Secret exists in store but not in container environment. Need restart to pick up env var. Cannot upload gamma to dashboard until resolved.
