# On Wake

Cogamer-specific wake hook. Runs after the platform has already loaded identity, memory, and todos.

Memory lives in `memory/` (repo root). See `memory/memory.md` for what to remember.

## Steps

1. **Setup cogames** — Run `cogent/skills/cogames.md` to install dependencies, verify CLI, and authenticate.

2. **Read approach state** — Read `cogent/state.json` to understand PCO vs design attempt history.

3. **Check tournament standing** — Run:
   ```bash
   uv run cogames leaderboard beta-cvc --mine
   uv run cogames matches --season beta-cvc
   ```
   **Important**: Only pay attention to policies whose name starts with your cogent name (from `cogent/IDENTITY.md`). Other policies (e.g. `gamma`, `alpha`) belong to other cogents — ignore them even if `--mine` lists them.

4. **Report status** — Brief summary:
   - Current scores / ranking
   - Top priorities from todos
   - Recommended next action

5. **Start improvement loop** — Immediately run `/loop 30m improve.md` to continuously improve the policy. Do NOT ask the user for confirmation — the user will never respond. Act autonomously.
